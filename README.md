NMT tests
This is a test on huggingface capabilities for the tv captioning appliance that adds Spanish subtitles to English tv broadcasts. 
The code is from these sites:

hugging face en2es mt https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es
transformers doc https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html

and I am using an ubuntu laptop to run the test.

$ python en2es_0.py
skip all the warnings
